# AlarmApp

This JavaScript code creates an alarm clock application. Users can set alarms at specific times and control when the alarm sound starts or stops.

How does it work?

1. The user enters the desired alarm time in the hour and minute entry fields.

2. When you click on the "Set Alarm" button, an alarm will be created with the entered hour and minute values and this alarm will be added to the alarm list without being activated.

3. The alarm list shows the inactive alarm, and there is a check box and clear button next to each alarm.

4. The user checks the checkbox to enable or disable an alarm.

5. When the alarm time comes, the alarm sound starts to play and the check box is automatically ticked.

6. User can remove an alarm from the alarm list by clicking on the delete button.
